# Introduction

This repository contains code to reproduce the results described in
my Medium blog post titled "How Practical Is Python For Prototyping Data Science Projects AtÂ Scale?"

# Requirements
* Docker 

# Usage
1. Navigate to this project's root directory.
2. Execute:
    ```shell script
    bash scripts/setup_environment.sh
    ```
   This will open a open Jupyter server on port 8888.
   
3. Open the link from step 2 in a web browser and navigate
to the notebooks folder to view the Julia and Python solutions.
